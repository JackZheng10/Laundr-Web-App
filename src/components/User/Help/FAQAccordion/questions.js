  {
    question: "How do monthly subscriptions work?",
    answer: `Subscriptions help you save the most money when placing orders! The plans will drop the price from $1.50 per pound to $1.20! 
    Each tier has an allotted amount of weight and is billed monthly.There are four different subscription plans. 
    The Student plan is 40 lbs for $40 (requires valid .edu email), the Standard plan is 48 lbs for $60, the Plus plan is 66 lbs for $80, and the Family is 88 lbs for $100.
    The Family plan has the added benefit of giving you subscription pricing regardless of how many pounds you use. 
    It will charge $1.20/lb instead of $1.50/lb for each pound after the initial 88 lbs are used. 
    Once your laundry is picked up, the driver will weigh your order. The weight provided will be subtracted from your monthly allotted pounds. 
    Each pound above the monthly allotted pounds will be charged as on-demand pricing.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in my monthly subscription?",
    answer: `Aside from saving money, subscribers get other benefits such as same-day delivery and personal Laundr bags. 
    Family plan subscribers get the added benefit of subscription pricing on any number of pounds they choose to use beyond their initial 88 lbs. `,

  {
    question: "How do I cancel my monthly subscription?",
    answer: `Although we believe you’ll love the service, you can cancel your subscription at any point under "Subscription", which can be accessed via the sidebar. 
    If it renews and none of the allotted pounds have been used, you will receive a full refund within the first 10 days.
